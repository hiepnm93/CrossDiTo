# CrossDiTo

> **A focused Xteink X4 Pro firmware fork of [CrossInk 1.5](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk), itself based on [CrossPoint Reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader).** CrossDiTo prioritizes reliable reading, responsive navigation, restrained power use, and clear typography.

### Supported Device

- Xteink X4 Pro

The current hardware-verified release is [CrossDiTo 1.5.1](./docs/releases/v1.5.1.md), based on CrossInk 1.5.0. The complete project history is in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## What's different in this fork

My goal with this fork was to maintain the core Crosspoint firmware while integrating my preferred typography and some lightweight reading statistics. I’ve focused on keeping the underlying system stable while layering in a few "nice-to-have" features and UI refinements along the way.

### Reader Fonts

The default fonts have been replaced with Lexend Deca and Bitter. These fonts have been chosen specifically to improve reading fluency and e-ink performance. These 'sturdier' typefaces feature uniform stroke weights and open geometries, allowing the X4 Pro to render crisp, high-contrast text with font-aliasing on while significantly reducing ghosting and artifacts.

- [Lexend Deca](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca) - A research-backed sans-serif typeface designed to improve reading fluency. Lexend was engineered based on the theory that reading issues are often a design problem (visual crowding) rather than a cognitive one.
- [Bitter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter) - A "contemporary" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on digital screens. The consistent stroke weight of Bitter helps it render particularly well on e-ink devices. The medium weight has been chosen specifically for improved rendering on the X4 Pro.

The UI now uses [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) as the display font which has improved readability at smaller sizes.

### Music and Supplemental Glyphs

- Built-in reader fonts include music notation, selected Cyrillic glyphs, and the Project Hail Mary CJK fallback ranges. Additional SD-card fonts retain emoji fallback support.

---

### Font Sizes

CrossDiTo includes 10 pt, 12 pt, 14 pt, and 16 pt built-in reader font sizes.

See [SD Card Fonts](./docs/sd-card-fonts.md) for installing additional font families and size ranges.

---

### Reader features

Reader Options, Focus Reading, Guide Dots, Force Paragraph Indents, reading stats, and finished-book behavior are documented in [Reader Features](./docs/reader-features.md).

### Custom button actions

CrossDiTo adds configurable button shortcuts.

See [Controls](./docs/controls.md) for the full action list and defaults.

## Tips for the best reading experience

CrossDiTo uses the X4 Pro's ESP32-S3 and PSRAM, but internal RAM and e-ink bandwidth are still constrained compared with a phone, tablet, or desktop app.

- Keep folders under about 200 files. For the smoothest browsing, aim for 50-100 files per folder.
- Having 1000+ books on the SD card is fine if they are split into smaller folders, such as by author, series, genre, or read/unread status.
- Avoid putting every book in the SD card root. The file browser has to scan and sort the current folder before it can show it.
- Text-first EPUBs are the best fit. Large image-heavy EPUBs, scanned books, comics, and omnibus files with thousands of sections may load slowly or fail under memory pressure.
- As a rough target, EPUBs under 20 MB tend to work the best. Files over 50 MB may still work, but they are more likely to be slow or memory-sensitive, especially if they contain many large images.
- If an EPUB is unusually slow, try [optimizing](./docs/webserver.md#epub-optimization) it with the built-in web optimizer (via File Transfer) before copying it to the SD card: remove unused high-resolution images, split very large omnibus files, and avoid embedding multiple full font families when possible.
- Use a reliable SD card and leave some free space. CrossDiTo stores settings, reading progress, cache files, stats, and generated book data on the card.

## Guides & Documentation

Visit [https://www.crossink.dev](https://www.crossink.dev) for more user guides and additional documentation.

### Phone Companion (experimental)

An Android app can push weather (manual values or [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) data) to the X4 Pro over Bluetooth LE. BLE runs **only** while the Phone Companion screen is open; normal reading is unaffected.

1. On the X4 Pro, open **Home → Phone Companion**. The reader advertises as `CrossDiTo-X4` and waits.
2. Install the companion APK (`android-companion/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`, or the APK attached to the release) on your phone and open it.
3. Grant the Bluetooth permissions, then tap **Connect** and pick the X4 Pro when it appears.
4. Type test weather into the form (location, temperatures, humidity, condition) or tap **Fetch weather** to pull it from Open-Meteo, then tap **Send to X4**.
5. The weather appears on the X4 Pro's screen. Press Back on the reader to close Phone Companion and switch BLE off again.

Protocol details and limits: [docs/companion-protocol.md](./docs/companion-protocol.md). Current limitations: weather only (calendar, notifications, battery and custom text are reserved message types), the snapshot lives only while the screen is open, and the manual mode is intended for testing.

## Development quick start

CrossDiTo uses PlatformIO for building and flashing firmware.

See [Getting Started](./docs/development/getting-started.md) for prerequisites, clone setup, and validation commands.

### Nix/NixOS

Nix/NixOS users can enter the development shell with either `nix develop` (flakes) or `nix-shell`:

```bash
nix develop -f nix
# or
nix-shell nix
```

To flash the X4 Pro's ESP32-S3, enable PlatformIO's udev rules in your NixOS configuration:

```nix
services.udev.packages = with pkgs; [ platformio-core.udev ];
```

After rebuilding the system configuration, reconnect the device or reload udev rules.

### Build / flash / monitor

Connect the X4 Pro via USB-C:

```sh
# Xteink X4 Pro
pio run -e x4-pro --target upload
```

`x4-pro` is the only production firmware environment. Running `pio run` without `-e` builds the same target.

See [Testing and Debugging](./docs/development/testing-debugging.md) for serial logging, simulator checks, static analysis, and bug-report guidance.
